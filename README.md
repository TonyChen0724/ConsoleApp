# ConsoleApp

An C# Desktop Application I built in Codrivr Simulation 2 years ago.

4 separate functions for the image processing pipeline (openCV library [C++], Capturing Reality command-line interface [C#], Graphical User Interface [C#]) for converting 360 videos into meshes that can be used in Unreal Game Engine.
